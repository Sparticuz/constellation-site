			<h2>Our Studio</h2>
			<p>Every day I open the studio, flip the light switch, tie my apron, and get to work. The studio is a special space—it is the fruition of a lot of dreams and hopes and hard work. It’s a place that feels like home. It’s a place infused with heritage. Our storefront studio and retail space is in the Seattle Fisherman’s Terminal building, a historic nautical spot that recently celebrated its 100th birthday. I love the wall of windows in our space, inviting people and sunlight in. I love smelling fresh ocean air. I love eating lunch on the dock with fishing boats. But what I love most are the possibilities that this place holds. This is where I do what I love—and every day here is a blessing. We take this blessing seriously. Our work is truly a manifestation of our philosophy: to use ink and paper to connect people.</p>

			<h2>We bring old school to another level.</h2>
			<p class="intro">This is Gutenberg. This is the eighteenth century. This is corsets and petticoats and embroidery.</p>
			<p>Our equipment is time-tested and well-worn, but we have restored everything with love—from rust and grime back to pristine printing condition. All of our presses are foot or hand powered and completely hand fed. Each sheet of paper goes through the press one at a time, and once through for each color printed. Same goes for type setting and image making. We use traditional wood and lead type and carefully hand set one letter at a time. Many of our pieces feature one of my hand-carved wood engravings. To say this is a labor of love is an understatement—but we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

			<h2>Letterpress &amp; Wood Engraving</h2>
			<p>Wood engraving is a printmaking technique in which an image is carved into an end grain block of wood with sharp metal tools. The image is inked and printed using pressure, much like the letterpress printing process. Dating back to the 15th century, wood engraving is the perfect historic complement to wood and lead type.</p>
			<p>I’ve fallen in love with the historic craft of engraving. It’s infinitely satisfying to see my ideas become sketches, then printing blocks, then beautiful letterpress prints. Wood engraving and printing on the iron handpress give me new opportunities to express myself, to experiment, and to create in a new medium. Letterpress and wood engraving? A match made in history!</p>

			<h2>We like to think of our cards as no matter what, no matter when cards.</h2>
			<p class="intro">These sentiments transcend occasions. You are home to me. You’re my favorite. I like you. These are anytime cards. They won’t go out of season or out of style.</p>
			<p>And they are anywhere cards, not meant to be tucked away in a drawer or tossed aside. They are pieces of art imbued with intimacy and emotion, meant for keeping and displaying. They look good framed, hung in your home. And with your sincere handwritten message? People will keep them forever.</p>
			<p>Remember the box of cards, photos, and letters you found at your grandma’s house? I want my grandkids to find that box at my house. That heirloom ephemera won’t happen by itself, we have to build a collection. (And somehow I doubt that our grandkids will care about our online paper trail.)</p>
			<p>A card is sweet in its sentiment and simplicity. It’s a gift, and giving is good—good for relationship. Good for the giver and for the receiver. Giving is essential to life, not for its extravagance, but for showing our loved ones we know, we care, we watch, and we listen.</p>

			<h2>Product partnering</h2>
			<p>We strongly believe that the best part of owning a business is the opportunities it creates to work with other creative people! We love to collaborate with other small businesses to create products, experiences and relationships. Our collaborations with Seattle Seed Co. and Treehouse Point have produced beautiful products that neither business could create alone. If you’re interested in collaborating, let us know. We’d love to hear from you.</p>

			<p>We founded Constellation &amp; Co. on the idea that community is important in life and in business, and that business and life should work well together. We work closely with our clients, getting to know them beyond their preferences about paper and pantone colors, so we can offer them a design that feels authentic. Our clients bring us into their lives at important moments like planning a wedding or launching a business, and we take our involvement in those times seriously. Outside of our company, we work with a large network of creative people and small businesses whose skills and products enable us to tackle bigger projects and offer more exciting work to our customers. The big picture for us is, we can’t do this alone.</p>
			<p>We offer full service graphic design and letterpress printing for a variety of client projects including wedding invitations, branding and print collateral for small businesses, and a line of letterpress greeting cards and paper gifts available in stores nationwide and in Canada. We use a mixture of modern and historical technologies to produce work that is sometimes sweet, sometimes sarcastic, but always inspired by handmade processes, vintage ephemera, and collaboration.</p>

				<h2>Seattle</h2>
				<p>This city is home to me in a way I couldn’t have predicted. Four years later, I’m still homesick when we leave and giddy when we return home. There’s nowhere in the world like Seattle. It fits us like a glove. This is where we’ve planted our feet, started our careers, grown our business, and made lifelong friends. This is where we’ll raise our kids. This is where we’ll grow old. This city—water &amp; mountains, gold rush &amp; midcentury modern, large yet small—it’s home.</p>
