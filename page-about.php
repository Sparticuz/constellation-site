			<h2>Our Studio</h2>
			<p>Every day I walk into the studio, flip the light switch, tie my apron, and get to work. The studio is a special space—it is the fruition of a lot of dreams and hopes and hard work. It’s a place that feels like home. It’s a place infused with heritage. Our building is rich with history—it’s ornate and strong, built in the wave of new construction after the 1889 Seattle fire. I love the exposed brick, the aged wood floors, and the huge window with the natural light it lets in. But what I love most are the possibilities that this place holds. This is where I do what I love—and every day here is a blessing. We take this blessing seriously. Our work is truly a manifestation of our philosophy: to use ink and paper to connect people.</p>

			<h2>We bring old school to another level.</h2>
			<p class="intro">This is Gutenberg. This is the eighteenth century. This is corsets and petticoats and embroidery.</p>
			<p>Our equipment is time-tested and well-worn, but we have restored everything with love—from rust and grime back to pristine printing condition. All of our presses are foot or hand powered and completely hand fed. Each sheet of paper goes through the press one at a time, and once through for each color printed. Same goes for type setting and image making. We use traditional wood and lead type and carefully hand set one letter at a time. Many of our pieces feature one of my hand-carved wood engravings. To say this is a labor of love is an understatement—but we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

			<h2>Wood Engraving</h2>
			<p>Wood engraving is a printmaking technique in which an image is carved into an end grain block of wood with sharp metal tools. The image is inked and printed using pressure, much like the letterpress printing process. Dating back to the 15th century, wood engraving is
the perfect historic complement to wood and lead type.</p>
			<p>For my birthday one year, Brad gave me unlimited
wood engraving lessons. My teacher, Carl Montford,
is absolutely a master of his craft, and I am honored to call him mentor and friend. He was the “matchmaker” who brought us together with the seller of our first press, and he even helped us move the press into our studio, which was not an easy task! Carl is an absolute treasure to the Seattle letterpress community. But more that that, he’s like family to us.</p>
<p>I’ve fallen in love with the historic craft of engraving. It’s infinitely satisfying to see my ideas become sketches, then printing blocks, then beautiful letterpress prints. Wood engraving and printing on the iron handpress give me new opportunities to express myself, to experiment, and to create in a new medium. Letterpress and wood engraving? A match made in history!</p>

			<h2>We like to think of our cards as no matter what, no matter when cards.</h2>
			<p class="intro">These sentiments transcend occasions. You are home to me. You’re my favorite. I like you. These are anytime cards. They won’t go out of season or out of style.</p>
			<p>And they are anywhere cards, not meant to be tucked away in a drawer or tossed aside. They are pieces of art imbued with intimacy and emotion, meant for keeping and displaying. They look good framed, hung in your home. And with your sincere handwritten message? People will keep them forever.</p>
			<p>Remember the box of cards, photos, and letters you found at your grandma’s house? I want my grandkids to find that box at my house. That heirloom ephemera won’t happen by itself, we have to build a collection. (And somehow I doubt that our grandkids will care about our online paper trail.)</p>
			<p>A card is sweet in its sentiment and simplicity. It’s a gift, and giving is good—good for relationship. Good for the giver and for the receiver. Giving is essential to life, not for its extravagance, but for showing our loved ones we know, we care, we watch, and we listen.</p>

			<h2>Product partnering</h2>
			<p>We strongly believe that the best part of owning a business is the opportunities it creates to work with other creative people! We love to collaborate with other small businesses to create products, experiences and relationships! Our collaborations with Seattle Seed Co. and Treehouse Point have produced beautiful products that neither business could create alone. If you’re interested in collaborating, let us know! We’d love
to hear from you.</p>

		<h2>Seattle</h2>
		<p>This city is home to me in a way I couldn’t have predicted. Four years later, I’m still homesick when we leave and giddy when we return home. There’s nowhere in the world like Seattle. It fits us like a glove. This is where we’ve planted our feet, started our careers, grown our business, and made lifelong friends. This is where we’ll raise our kids. This is where we’ll grow old. This city—water &amp; mountains, gold rush &amp; midcentury modern, large yet small—it’s home.</p>
